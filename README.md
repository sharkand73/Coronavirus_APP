# Coronavirus Dashboard

This React app was a weekend homework project on the CodeClan "Professional Software Development" course.  

It extracts COVID data from a public UK Government API: https://api.coronavirus.data.gov.uk/v1/data and displays some of it in a table.  Although it is from a UK source, the data has been filtered for Scotland.  When you click on a row, a graph for the corresponding statistic appears.


## Running the app

Clone the repo and in the project directory, run: 

### `npm install`

Then you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
